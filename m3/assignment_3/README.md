# Assignment 3: AI Study Assistant

## Project Overview
In this assignment, my teammate and I developed an AI-powered study assistant using **Flowise AI**. The assistant is designed to help students create **lesson revision plans** and perform **mathematical computations** using external tools. To enhance accessibility, we integrated the agent with a **Streamlit app** for a user-friendly interface.

## Key Features
- **Language Model**: Uses **DeepSeek R1** as the core LLM.
- **Tool Integration**:
  - **Wolfram Alpha**: Handles complex mathematical and computational queries.
  - **Revision Plan Generator**: A specialized chain tool that follows a predefined template to generate structured study plans.
- **File Upload Support**: Allows users to upload their own lesson notes, which the agent processes to create personalized revision plans.

## Team Contributions
- **Karolina**:
  - Implemented the Flowise AI agent with the required tools.
  - Configured DeepSeek R1 for efficient processing.
- **Minh**:
  - Developed the Streamlit interface for better user interaction.
  - Integrated file upload capabilities for custom lesson plans.
