# KIVA - an analysis on lending activity and customer demography

Kiva.org is an online crowdfunding platform to extend financial services to poor and financially excluded people around the world
We are doing EDA to hopefully gain some inferences based on a limited set of information for each borrower, which help lenders better understand their targeted communities.

### Data set used:
* [Kiva Data Snapshot](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kiva/data-science-for-good-kiva-crowdfunding/data)


After some premilinary analysis on the dataset, I put everything together into a Streamlit app for better view and comprehension.
